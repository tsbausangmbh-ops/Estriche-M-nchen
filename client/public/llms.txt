## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does screed cost per square meter in Munich?
Screed prices in Munich range from 25-80€ per square meter depending on type:
- Cement screed: 25-35€/m²
- Flow screed: 28-40€/m²
- Quick screed: 40-55€/m²
- Industrial screed: 45-80€/m²
The exact price depends on thickness, floor level, and additional services.

### How long does screed take to dry?
Drying time varies by screed type:
- Cement screed: approximately 1 day per mm thickness (50mm = 50 days)
- Quick screed: ready for covering in 1-7 days
- Calcium sulfate flow screed: slightly faster than cement screed

### Which screed is best for underfloor heating?
Calcium sulfate flow screed (CAF) is ideal for underfloor heating due to its better thermal conductivity and more even heat distribution. Cement screed also works well but takes longer to heat up.

### Can underfloor heating be retrofitted?
Yes, using the milling method, heating pipes can be routed directly into the existing screed without removing the old floor. Installation takes only 2-4 days and is possible even in occupied rooms.
